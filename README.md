# My Advent of Code 2023
This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. 

This year, I will go with **C#** (again). My focus will be in strengthening my knowledge and skills in building solutions for each day that are optimized for **performance**.

Each solution will have a `README.md` in it's folder. For benchmark results check them out via the links below.
